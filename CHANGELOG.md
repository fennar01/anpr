## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-XX

### 🎉 Major Release - Simplified Prototype

This release focuses on getting a stable, working foundation for the ANPR app. All complex features have been temporarily replaced with placeholders to ensure the app loads and runs properly.

#### ✅ Added
- **Basic App Structure**: Clean React Native/Expo app with TypeScript
- **Tab Navigation**: Bottom tab navigation between Camera and History screens
- **Placeholder UI**: Mock camera and history interfaces with proper styling
- **Simplified Services**: Placeholder implementations for PlateRecognitionService and Database
- **Development Setup**: Clean Expo SDK 53 setup with minimal dependencies
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console logging throughout the app

#### 🔧 Changed
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Removed all problematic native modules temporarily
- **App Initialization**: Removed complex async initialization that was causing loading issues
- **Camera Screen**: Replaced real camera with styled placeholder interface
- **History Screen**: Replaced database integration with mock data display
- **Service Architecture**: All services now use placeholder implementations with logging

#### 🐛 Fixed
- **App Loading Issues**: Resolved module resolution errors that prevented app from starting
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Eliminated conflicts between native modules
- **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed all type-related issues
- **Metro Bundler Issues**: Resolved webpack and bundler configuration problems
- **Port Conflicts**: Fixed port 8081 conflicts with proper cleanup

#### 🗑️ Removed
- **Complex Dependencies**: Temporarily removed expo-camera, ML Kit, SQLite, and other native modules
- **Async Initialization**: Removed complex startup sequence that was causing failures
- **Real Camera Integration**: Replaced with placeholder for stability
- **Database Integration**: Replaced with mock data for development
- **Geolocation Services**: Removed location tracking temporarily
- **Push Notifications**: Removed notification services temporarily

#### 📝 Technical Details
- **Expo SDK**: 53.0.0
- **React Native**: 0.79.3
- **TypeScript**: 5.1.3
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6.x
- **Platform Support**: iOS, Android, Web (basic)

#### 🚧 Known Limitations
- Camera functionality is placeholder only
- No real license plate recognition
- No database storage
- No location tracking
- No push notifications

#### 🔮 Next Steps
1. Add real camera integration using expo-camera
2. Implement ML Kit text recognition
3. Add SQLite database functionality
4. Restore geolocation services
5. Add push notification support

## Development Notes

### Why This Approach?
The app was experiencing persistent loading issues due to complex dependency interactions and initialization sequences. The decision was made to:

1. **Simplify First**: Get a working foundation with placeholders
2. **Stabilize**: Ensure the app loads and runs consistently
3. **Incrementally Add**: Add real functionality one feature at a time
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate each addition before moving to the next

### Current Status
- ✅ App loads and runs consistently
- ✅ Navigation works properly
- ✅ UI is responsive and styled
- ✅ Development environment is stable
- 🚧 Real functionality needs to be added incrementally

### Future Releases
- **v1.1.0**: Add real camera functionality
- **v1.2.0**: Implement ML Kit text recognition
- **v1.3.0**: Add database storage
- **v1.4.0**: Restore geolocation and notifications
- **v2.0.0**: Full ANPR functionality

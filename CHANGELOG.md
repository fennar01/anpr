# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Placeholder favicon added to `assets/favicon.png` to resolve missing file error for web builds.
- Created web mocks for native modules in `src/mocks/`:
  - `react-native-sqlite-storage.web.ts`
  - `@notifee/react-native.web.ts`
  - `@react-native-community/geolocation.web.ts`
  - `@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition.web.ts`
- These allow the app to load in the browser with native features disabled.

### Fixed
- Expo/React Native dependency versions fixed for compatibility.
- Installed web dependencies for Expo.
- Forced install of `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` using `--legacy-peer-deps` to bypass Expo/React Native dependency conflict and allow navigation to work.
- Improved web mock implementation using `Platform.OS` checks instead of `typeof window` for better webpack compatibility.
- Added try-catch blocks for native module imports to handle cases where modules are not available.

### Upgraded
- **Upgraded from Expo SDK 49 to SDK 53** for compatibility with latest Expo Go app.
- Updated all dependencies to SDK 53 compatible versions:
  - `expo-camera`: ~16.1.8
  - `expo-image-manipulator`: ~13.1.7
  - `expo-status-bar`: ~2.2.3
  - `react`: 19.0.0
  - `react-native`: 0.79.3
  - `react-native-reanimated`: ~3.17.4
  - `react-native-screens`: ~4.11.1
  - `react-native-safe-area-context`: 5.4.0
  - `react-native-web`: ^0.20.0
  - `react-dom`: 19.0.0
  - `@types/react`: ~19.0.10
- Fixed breaking changes in Camera API (replaced `CameraType.back` with `facing="back"`).
- Removed missing `adaptive-icon.png` reference from app.json.

### Issues
- Installing `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` failed due to a dependency conflict with `react-native-screens`. Upgrading `react-native-screens` to a compatible version.
- Attempted to upgrade `react-native-screens` to `~4.20.0` for navigation compatibility, but the upgrade did not succeed. The dependency conflict with `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` persists.
